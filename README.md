# Web Development Tasks


Product landing page : In this project, I created a modern and responsive product landing page using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The landing page features a clean and professional design, incorporating various web development techniques. I used Bootstrap's grid system to align components within columns, ensuring a structured and visually appealing layout. The design includes a navigation bar, a hero section with a call-to-action button, and a featured product area.

Additionally, I applied basic image editing tasks such as cropping to enhance the visual presentation. By utilizing design templates, I streamlined the process, achieving a cohesive and polished look. Through this project, I gained practical experience in web design, learned how to implement responsive layouts, and improved my skills in CSS styling and Bootstrap framework usage.


Quiz Application : In this project, I developed a quiz application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I designed a responsive and visually appealing interface, incorporating a background image and custom styles for a clean look. The quiz functionality includes loading questions, selecting answers, and displaying the result with animations for an enhanced user experience. I learned how to manipulate the DOM dynamically to update quiz questions and options, manage user interactions, and validate responses. Additionally, I gained experience in using CSS transitions and animations to create a more engaging and interactive web application.

Interactive Web Music Player : In this project, the player features a sleek, modern design with a responsive user interface, including a play/pause button ▶️, stop button ⏹️, file input for selecting audio files 📁, and a seek bar for navigation 🎚️. I incorporated animations and transitions to enhance the user experience, such as rotating the album art when music is playing 🎵 and hover effects on buttons ✨. The JavaScript code manages audio playback 🎧, updates the seek bar as the audio plays, and handles user interactions with the controls. Through this project, I gained valuable skills in web development 💻, including creating interactive elements, handling media files 🎶, and applying dynamic styling with CSS animations 🎨.
