# Product Landing Page


In this project, I created a modern and responsive product landing page using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The landing page features a clean and professional design, incorporating various web development techniques. I used Bootstrap's grid system to align components within columns, ensuring a structured and visually appealing layout. The design includes a navigation bar, a hero section with a call-to-action button, and a featured product area.

Additionally, I applied basic image editing tasks such as cropping to enhance the visual presentation. By utilizing design templates, I streamlined the process, achieving a cohesive and polished look. Through this project, I gained practical experience in web design, learned how to implement responsive layouts, and improved my skills in CSS styling and Bootstrap framework usage.
